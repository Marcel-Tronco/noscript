What's even more vanilla than vanillaJS? Right, don't bother using JavaScript at all!

## Description

This is a repo that wants to address to things:

Firstly, and maybe most importantly, making a little fun about the depriciation that people face, who use HTML features extensively.

Secondly, creating a mixture between handbook and wiki, that practically shows HTML browser capabilities and shows cases where JavaScript can be avoided.

## Intro

Using all features of HTML and CSS without the need of JavaScript seems to be a very offensive idea to a lot of programmers. The amount of memes addressing this is enormous. I don't want to dig to deep into why just using APIs through a markup language seems to be hitting the nerv of the every modern JavaScript frontend developer, showing them that in the end all they do is moving some divs and flexing boxes...

The point I wanna make is, that in most cases it's just worse to stitch together HTML-Elements and broswer API-Calls on your own, hoping to not overlook the pitfalls. You're putting the user in a paradoxical situation: your forcing them to trust the very you to use the code from you, who can't build a website without JavaScript, that really doesn't need it.

So fellow JavaScript developer, let go of the need to impress people with your hacky code bits, let go of the illusion that it makes anything better if you hide your HTML in JavaScript files, letting a code block produce the div that you're feeling too sophisticated to write with your own hands, but still clinging to use jsx syntax to make it obvious that that's just what you're doing.

Just join me in this universe of freedom!
